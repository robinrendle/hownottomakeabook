I was on the hunt for blackletter typefaces this week whilst doing some research for the book and I stumbled upon a Polish collection of mythologies from the 16th century called [_Prawdziwe wyobrażenie trojga dzieci_](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/33795/prawdziwe-wyobrazenie-trojga-dzieci-second-ed) which [Ada Pawlikowska](https://ada.pawlikowska.com/projects) designed for her doctoral dissertation.

I think it’s so very beautiful. Just look at this thing!

The white space! The typesetting! The soft hint of blue in the illustrations! [Escapade](https://www.type-together.com/eskapade-font)! It’s all remarkable stuff that I want to steal for my own book, but this little object reminded me of two things that I should keep in mind once I focus on the design of this project:

1. My book doesn’t have to limit itself to novel-esque layouts with endless columns of text all over the place—I can be really playful with illustrations and design!
2. I should experiment more with lots of white space like this!

Looking at Ada’s work reminds me that she treats this book less like a traditional book and more like a series of slides. And over the past few years I’ve been experimenting with websites that force you to view each idea one-by-one, just like a side.

With [Newsletters](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/newsletters/) for example I showed just an illustration and a sliver of text...

...and likewise with [In Praise of Shadows](https://www.robinrendle.com/essays/in-praise-of-shadows/) I forced the reader to only see one paragraph at a time...

(To me there’s a satisfying clunk with "Ugh" printed on one slide that you simply cannot get in a regular ol’ paragraph. It’s almost...musical?)

Anyway, I wanted to control the scroll so that I could control the reading experience and add _emphasis_ wherever I pleased. Moving words onto different "slides" encourages a certain kind of reading, a certain kind of pace, that I am absolutely stealing from comic books. But I realize now as I look over this Polish collection of myths, that I can do the very same thing with a book of my own: chunking up or breaking down the words in unconventional ways to add emphasis.

Likewise, [Jason](https://jason.cosper.me/) shared this tiny website by Helena Jaramillo called [_soft soft soft soft soft soft soft soft soft soft soft soft soft tech_](https://mmm.page/helena.soft_tech) that does pretty much the same thing but I think less obnoxiously because it doesn’t hijack the scroll and treats the browser more like an infinite canvas....

So! I shouldn’t limit myself to a novel-shaped thing, or a series of spreads with nothing more than columns of text. I should instead think of a spread in this book as a slide in a presentation: if an idea requires just a single sentence on a whole spread to really emphasize it then I think I should do that! Screw it! Let’s take all the space we need! There’s no printer or editor or anyone else telling me I can’t or shouldn’t and if it makes the book more fun / more interesting / less like other books then I think it’s worth trying.

With a book there’s a finite canvas in the literal sense—you’re always confined to the format and the few inches that a physical book gives you—but there is an _infinite_ canvas in terms of possibility! I can play with text and image in the same way that a comic book or a website can: with just a sliver of text and copious amounts of white space, whole galaxies crack open, ready for the taking. I shouldn’t just be looking at other books as inspiration then, but other mediums and formats, too.

Because an infinite canvas awaits.
